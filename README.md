# CryptoClustering

The CryptoClustering folder contains following files:

- Resources subfolder that contains crypto_market_data.csv file 
- Crypto_Clustering.ipynb -> Jupyter notebook file that contains the solution. Code has lots of comments, so it will be easier to follow.

I have asnwered all the questions in above ipynb file (markdown) and file contains all the charts as well.

Had to define a System environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 to hide the warning as suggested in the link above.
